# compSysAssignment2
Assignment 2 for the Computer System and Networks module on the hDip in Computer Science 2023 in SETU

The intention of this assignment is to create a system to assistant a person with ADHD who experiences great difficulty in certain areas of executive functioning. This project uses a rasberry pi 4 with a sensehat to visually communicate the users current ETA relative to their workplace. A mixture of this, MQTT messages and smart lightbulbs will continue to keep the users time keeping in check. Once they've departed and their smart phone has left the local network, their departure time is recorded relative to their desired ETA. The differences in these times is then recorded and used to offset future ETA's, ensuring the user's difficulty in managing their time is accounted for.
The scope of this project may change over time and software will be updated as the project progresses.
